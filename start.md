# HTML Structure
This template is a responsive layout with 9 sections. All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with an id of "main". The general template structure is the same throughout the template. Here is the general structure.

``` html
<div id="page">
  <header id="header" class="site-header"></header>
  <main id="main" class="site-main">
    <section id="carousel-1" class="carousel slide section-slide" data-ride="carousel"></section>
    <section class="section section-center cta"></section>
    <section id="features" class="section section-center section-hilite section-features"></section>
    <section id="portfolio" class="section section-portfolio"></section>
    <section id="testimonials" class="section section-center section-hilite section-testimonial"></section>
    <section id="pricing" class="section section-center section-pricing"></section>
    <section id="team" class="section section-center section-hilite section-team"></section>
    <section id="blog" class="section section-blog"></section>
    <section id="clients" class="section section-hilite section-our-clients"></section>
    <section id="contact" class="section section-center section-cta"></section>
  </main>
  <footer id="footer" class="site-footer"></footer>
</div>
```

Each section need have class of "section" to apply global section style.

**What class names mean?**

If you would like to align center the text & content, you would add class of "section-center"

I.E.

``` html
<section id="section-id" class="section section-center">
```

If you would like to hilite a section, you would add class of "section-hilite"

I.E.

``` html
<section id="section-id" class="section section-hilite">
```
